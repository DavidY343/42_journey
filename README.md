# My 42 Madrid Journey

Welcome to the summary of my 42 Madrid journey! Below is an overview of each project I tackled during the program, highlighting the key skills and lessons I learned along the way.

## Projects Overview

- **libft** – The foundational project where I reimplemented a selection of standard C library functions (like `ft_strlen`, `ft_memcpy`, and more) from scratch. This project helped me solidify my understanding of pointers, memory management, and writing clean, reusable code.

- **ft_printf** – In this project, I created a simplified version of the standard `printf` function, supporting various format specifiers (such as `%d`, `%s`, `%x`, etc.). This taught me about variable argument lists (`va_list`), string parsing, and handling formatting flags and width/precision.

- **get_next_line** – Here, I developed a function that reads a file descriptor line by line, returning one line per call regardless of buffer size. This project enhanced my grasp of static variables, efficient buffer management, memory allocation, and edge-case handling.

- **pipex** – In `pipex`, I replicated basic shell piping behavior: creating child processes, using `fork`, `execve`, and setting up pipes to pass output from one command to another. I deepened my knowledge of inter-process communication and process control.

- **philo** (Philosophers) – This concurrent programming challenge modeled the dining philosophers problem, demanding proper use of threads, mutexes, and synchronization to avoid deadlocks and race conditions. It improved my understanding of concurrency and thread-safe design.

- **push_swap** – For `push_swap`, I designed an algorithm to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of stack operations and aimed to minimize the total moves. This project sharpened my algorithmic thinking, stack manipulation, and optimizing strategies under constraints.

- **so_long** – In this 2D game project using the MiniLibX graphics library, I built a simple maze where a player collects items and reaches an exit. I strengthened my skills in graphics rendering, event handling, game logic, and dynamic memory management for game assets.

- **inception** – The final project where I deployed a small-scale Dockerized infrastructure, including a web server, database, and other services, to run a web application stack. I learned the basics of containerization with Docker, service orchestration, and deployment best practices.

## How to Navigate This Repository

1. Each project folder (e.g., `libft/`, `ft_printf/`) contains its own `README.md` with build instructions, project-specific details, and usage examples.
2. Feel free to explore the source code, test files, and your own notes to see how your skills evolved from low-level C up to system deployment.
3. See the `inception/` directory for a real showcase of production-ready skills using Docker and service integration.
